Repository of the projects and coursework throughout my time in this data science program

Class List:

- Spring 2021
  - **W200: Introduction to Data Science Programming**
  > This fast-paced course aims to give students the fundamental Python knowledge necessary for more advanced work in data science. The course structure provides students with frequent opportunities to practice writing code, gradually building to an advanced set of skills focused on data science applications.
  - **W201: Research Design & Applications for Data & Analysis**
  >This course introduces students to the burgeoning data sciences landscape, with a particular focus on learning how to apply data science techniques to uncover, enrich, and answer the questions you will encounter and originate in the industry.
  
- Summer 2021
  - **W203: Statistics for Data Science**
  >The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundational understanding of classical statistics and how it fits within the broader context of data science. Students will learn to apply the most common statistical procedures correctly, checking assumptions and responding appropriately when they appear violated.
  
  - **W205: Fundamentals of Data Engineering**
  >This course introduces the fundamental knowledge and skills of data engineering that are required to be effective as a data scientist. This course focuses on the basics of data pipelines, data pipeline flows and associated business use cases, and how organizations derive value from data and data engineering.
  
- Fall 2021
  - **W207: Applied Machine Learning**
  > Through a variety of lecture examples and programming projects, students will learn how to apply powerful machine-learning techniques to new problems, how to run evaluations and interpret results, and how to think about scaling up from thousands of data points to billions.

- Spring 2022
  - **W261: Machine Learning at Scale**
  > This course builds on and goes beyond this collect-and-analyze phase of big data by focusing on how machine learning algorithms can be rewritten and in some cases extended to scale to work on petabytes of data, both structured and unstructured, to generate sophisticated models that can be used for real-time predictions.

- Fall 2022
  - **W266: Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning**
  - **W209: Data Visualization**
